## About me

A 22-year-old girl who does not lose hope of becoming a JS developer. At the time of graduation from the university (BSUIR), there was no clear awareness of who I want to be and what I want to do in this life. That's why I'm here and this is my second attempt to finish RSSchool =)

## Skills

* HTML

* JavaScript (Basic)
* Git

## Code Example

  $('.header_burger').click(function() {
        $('.header_burger').toggleClass('open-menu');
        $('.nav').toggleClass('open-menu');
    });
```
